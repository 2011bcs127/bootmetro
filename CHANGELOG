v1.0 pre (07/12/2012)
=================================

Pivot plugin (bootmetro-pivot.js)
---------------------------------
The markup for the pivot-headers anchors has changed: the attribute data-to has been renamed to data-pivot-index, so now it's name is more semantic, since his value is the index of the item to display.
Note that the pivot plugin, due to the fact that in reality is the bootstrap-carousel with something less, has a serious issue (see https://github.com/aozora/bootmetro/issues/45 ) that probably  will lead me to rewrite this plugin from zero; I hope in that case to not break anything.


Panorama
---------------------------------
The markup has changed from:

      <div id="hub" class="metro panorama span12">

            <div class="panorama-sections">

            ...
            </div>
      </div>
      <a id="panorama-scroll-prev" href="#">&#xe05d;</a>
      <a id="panorama-scroll-next" href="#">&#xe059;</a>

to this:

      <div id="hub" class="metro span12">

         <div class="panorama">

            <div class="panorama-sections">

            ...
            </div>
         </div>
         <a id="panorama-scroll-prev" href="#">&#xe05d;</a>
         <a id="panorama-scroll-next" href="#">&#xe059;</a>
      </div>


All pages markup:
---------------------------------
In all the demo pages I replaced the fluid css classes with the non fluid ones, so "container-fluid" is now, "container", and "row-fluid" is "row".

On the header element <header id="nav-bar"> I have removed the -fluid suffix from his inner div's; the elements <div id="header-container"> and <div id="top-info"> are now contained in the same div with class="span12"; before that row was split within 2 span.
This change was necessary to improve the responsive design for the header for lower resolutions ( < 798px width).


Theme Css Files
---------------------------------
the theme css files, metro-ui-light and metro-ui-dark are no longer used. metro-ui-light is renamed bootmetro-ui-light, and it is built with less.
The dark theme will be rebuilt with less in the next minor release.
