            Early in 2012, when Microsoft released the first beta of Windows 8 I finally had the opportunity to try the "Metro UI" (now renamed to... Windows 8 App Store style).
            At that time the UI guidelines was almost done, and also the "direction" set by microsoft was clear. I looked for other references of Metro style around the web, and there was nothing or little info apart the official one.
            <br/>
            So I had the idea "why not recreate in pure HTML5/CSS3 the win 8 style ?". I was already working with the beautiful Twitter Bootstrap framework and I thought that it was relatively simple to customize it to recreate a metro style.
            So... I started it.
            <br/>
            At the same time I found the project MetroUI-CSS, by Sergey Pimenov, that evidently have had the same idea, but with some missing things from the original Metro guidelines, but his development was already ahead of mine.
            So, that's the story that started all about BootMetro!
